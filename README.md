# Gear-and-Grit

**Gear-and-Grit** is a third-person, procedurally generated tower escape game set in a collapsing construction site. As the structure crumbles beneath you, your only goal is to ascend—fast and smart.

## Overview  
A vertical action-platformer where hesitation means death.

---

## Features  
- **Procedurally Generated Levels** – No two climbs are ever the same.  
- **Grappling Hook (Tape Measure)** – Master the physics to chain momentum and reach new heights.  
- **Double Jump** – Maneuver with precision in high-pressure scenarios.  
- **Dynamic Collapse System** – The world falls apart as you climb. Keep moving or get buried.  
- **Fluid Movement** – Built for momentum and quick reactions.
